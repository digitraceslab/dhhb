Course Description
==================
The primary audience of this course is BSc students in their final year and MSc students with knowledge of Python and data science. You can find the course and enroll on Sisu by searching for the course code "CS-C4100". This is a 5-credit course over period II.

Overview
----------------
In the past two decades, connected devices like smartphones, smartwatches, and online platforms like social media have become essential to our daily lives. Interacting with these devices and platforms, we leave digital traces behind. We often hear companies accessing these digital traces (our data) can learn much about our lives and behavior. But what exactly can be learned from these data, how it can be learned, and for what purposes can it be used? In this course, we learn about different kinds of digital traces that people leave behind. Working with data in some case studies, we learn how to extract from these data. We also discuss different ways to use the extracted information from the data. We focus on use cases that are related to health and well-being (e.g., self-tracking, monitoring people's sentiments during crises on social media, and digital phenotyping).

Learning outcomes
-----------------
After completing this course, you will learn how digital data from people (e.g., data from their smartwatches) can be used to measure different aspects of their behavior at individual and group levels. You will also learn how this information can be used in health and public health domains. By the end of the course, you will know what kind of questions can be answered using such data, and you will be able to implement code to extract relevant and valuable information from such data.

Description
----------------
This course will cover topics related to quantifying human behavior, health, and well-being using digital traces at the individual and group/society levels. The topics include 1) quantified-self, 2) digital data collection and analysis of behavioral and/or physiological data in the wild as well and 3) controlled digital data collection via recruitment of study participants for the purpose of quantifying behavior, health, and well-being, 4) digital phenotyping, 5) digital phenotyping for public health and 6) ethics, privacy and validity assessment in the context of all the topics covered in the course.
