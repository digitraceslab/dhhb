Course Description
==================

Overview
----------------
Connected devices like smartphones and smartwatches as well as online platforms like social media have become an important part of our daily lives in the past two decades. Interacting with these devices and platforms we leave digital traces behind. We often hear about companies having access to these digital traces (our data) can find out a lot about our lives and behavior. But what exactly can be learned from these data, how it can be learned and for what purposes can it be used? In this course we learn about different kinds of digital traces that people leave behind. Working with data in some case studies, we learn how to extract from these data. We also discuss different ways the extracted information from the data can be used. We focus on use cases which are related to health and well-being (e.g. self-tracking, monitoring people's sentiments during crises on social media, digital phenotyping).

Learning outcomes
-----------------
After completing this course you will learn how digital data from people (e.g. data from their smartwatches) can be used to measure different aspects of their behavior at individual and group level. You will also learn how this information can be used in the domains of health and public health. By the end of the course you will know what kind of questions can be answered using such data and you will be able to implement code to extract relevant and useful information from such data.

Description
----------------
This course will cover topics related to quantifying human behavior, health and well-being using digital traces both at the individual level and group/society level. The topics include: 1) quantified-self, 2) digital data collection and analysis of behavioral and/or physiological data in the wild as well as 3) controlled digital data collection via recruitment of study participants for the purpose of quantifying behavior, health and well-being, 4) digital phenotyping, 5) digital phenotyping for public health and 6) ethics, privacy and validity assessment in the context of all the topics covered in the course.
